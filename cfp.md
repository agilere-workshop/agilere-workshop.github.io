## Goals and Motivation

For practitioners, requirements engineering (RE) in agile development plays an important role. Organisations that have formed agile development teams to build products or to offer development services need to be able to feed the backlogs of these teams continuously based on requirements elicited from customers, product managers, and other stakeholders. But agile RE starts even earlier than that; when new product ideas are developed or organisations work with customers to identify the product vision and then refine that vision iteratively to form backlog items, acceptance criteria, and sprint goals.

These scenarios require RE approaches that are tailored to an iterative-incremental way of working. This entails creating the minimal amount of documentation and overhead to achieve their purpose and that produce tangible work items early on. Following the agile manifesto, these approaches need to be flexible and adaptable, with a focus on communication and responsiveness to change rather than on processes and documentation.

In the AgileRE workshop, practitioners and academics are going to review and discuss the current state of the art and practice of agile requirements engineering. Based on presentations from industry and academia and interlaced with hands-on tutorials, the participants will learn about how organisations that employ agile development handle requirements, what scaling means for agile RE, and what the future of requirements engineering in agile environments will hold.

## Topic of the Workshop

We welcome contributions that pertain to any aspects of Agile RE. This is a community-building workshop and, as such, we do not over-constrain its scope. Nevertheless, we identified a few topics that are certainly within the scope:

 * RE-related activities and ceremonies in agile development;
 * Shared understanding, also through non-linguistic artifacts;
 * Documentation of requirements;
 * RE phases prior to the definition of the backlog;
 * AI techniques that can be used to support Agile RE practitioners;
 * Studies on the transition to or away from agile development;
 * Role of models and modeling paradigms;
 * Experiments and case studies;
 * Agile RE education and training;
 * New or revised theories of RE in agile settings.

## Workshop Format
 
The AgileRE workshop will have a varied program with different activities that are designed to allow for discussion and exchange of views. We aim to combine the advantages of traditional, paper-based workshops for academics with the accessibility of paperless workshops for practitioners. We also aim to include mini-tutorials and discussion sessions into the program.

## Paper submission and Selection

The AgileRE workshop will have three options for contributions:

 * A classic *paper submission* option, which we anticipate will mostly be used by academics. Paper submission will follow the REFSQ standards w.r.t. formatting for workshops ([CEUR-Art single column template](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip), also available as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw)).
   * Full paper (up to 8 pages + 1 for references), describing a technical solution, an experience, a case study, or other scientific contributions pertaining to the topic of the workshop.
   * Short paper (up to 4+1 pages) -- presenting a vision or perspective regarding the identity, distinguishing traits and future of Agile RE.
 * A *presentation proposal* option, which is mostly aimed at practitioners. Interested parties can submit a short summary (1 page) of a presentation they intend to hold. 
 * A *mini-tutorial proposal*, which is aimed at both academics and practitioners. Interested parties can submit a short summary of the tutorial they intend to give. These mini-tutorials are expected to take 30--45 minute each.

 All papers have to be submitted using [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=agilere2024). *The deadline for submission is February 16, 2024, anywhere on earth.* Please submit your abstract by *February 9*.

All types of contributions will be reviewed by the program committee, which consists of renowned experts in the field (see next section for some candidates). Papers will be reviewed based on novelty, relevance, rigor, verifiability, and presentation. Presentations will be reviewed based on relevance; tutorials will be reviewed based on relevance, duration, expected outcome, and pedagogical approach.
Each contribution will be reviewed by at least three program committee members in a single-blind process, following good scientific practice.
