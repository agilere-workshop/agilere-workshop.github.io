We are very happy that Markus Meuten, agile coach, trainer, and working group leader as IREB will give the keynote at the AgileRE workshop. His topic will be &quot; A FAREWELL OR A NEW DIRECTION? The future of requirements engineering in the agile era&quot;. With a humorous look at the tension between RE and agility, we will uncover why &quot;agile requirements engineering&quot; is not a contradiction but rather an opportunity to positively
influence and optimize collaboration between both worlds.
