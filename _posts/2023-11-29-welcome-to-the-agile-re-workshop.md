The AgileRE workshop is coming to REFSQ 2024! We are very happy to announce that AgileRE will be hosted by REFSQ 2024 in Winterthur and that we will be able to dedicate a whole day to inspiring talks, technical demonstrations, engaging discussions, and many other activities. 

In the AgileRE workshop, practitioners and academics are going to review and discuss the current state of the art and practice of agile requirements engineering. Based on presentations from industry and academia and interlaced with hands-on tutorials, the participants will learn about how organisations that employ agile development handle requirements, what scaling means for agile RE, and what the future of requirements engineering in agile environments will hold.

The AgileRE team is looking forward to seeing you in Switzerland!
