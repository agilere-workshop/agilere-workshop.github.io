## A FAREWELL OR A NEW DIRECTION? The future of requirements engineering in the agile era

In our increasingly volatile and fast-paced technology world, requirements engineering (RE)
remains an essential cornerstone in the development of software and system projects.
However, the question arises: What does the future of RE look like in the agile world?

Our complex and constantly changing technology landscape requires an evolutionary
reorientation of RE that goes beyond the mere formulation of user stories. As each solution
development faces individual challenges such as cultural differences, legal constraints and
risk management, we need a more sophisticated approach. The challenge here is to strike
a balance between agility and stability to both respond quickly to change and maintain complexity
and quality of requirements.

In this talk, the public available Req42 framework will be introduced as a helping hand  - an
experience based approach that meets these requirements and aims to shift the focus from
output to outcome. Using this framework, we will explore how a proactive and results-oriented
approach to RE in the agile world can contribute to the success of projects.

With a humorous look at the tension between RE and agility, we will uncover why "agile
requirements engineering" is not a contradiction but rather an opportunity to positively
influence and optimize collaboration between both worlds.
