*Agile transition - Who owns the requirements?*<br/>
Andrea Wohlgemuth<br/>
Abstract:
Responsibility for requirements in agile setups is loosely defined and even shifts within agile transition. While some consider the product owner responsible, others consider the product manager or development team responsible for requirements. In this experience report presentation, we want to outline different agile transition setups as experienced in the (intra-)logistics context. For each of these setups, we present challenges related to requirements responsibility.
